In this article, I'll guide you through the process of installing and configuring MSYS2 on your Windows system.

## What is MSYS2?

MSYS2 is a software distribution and building platform for Windows. It provides a Unix-like environment and a collection of tools, utilities, and libraries aimed at enabling efficient software development and system administration tasks. MSYS2 offers a convenient way to work with command-line interfaces, execute shell scripts, and compile software projects originally designed for Unix-like operating systems.

## Installing MSYS2

To get started with MSYS2, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download**: Head over to the MSYS2 website (<https://www.msys2.org/>) and download the installer.

2. **Installation**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. By default, MSYS2 installs to `C:\msys64` for 64-bit systems or `C:\msys32` for 32-bit systems.

    > Attention! Install MSYS2 only on short ASCII-only path on a NTFS volume with no accents, no spaces, no symlinks, no subst or network drives, no FAT.

3. **Initialization**: Once the installation is complete, there should be a shell launched automatically. If not, launch one of the MSYS2 shells `ucrt64.exe` or `mingw64.exe` from your MSYS2 installation directory.

4. **Update**: In the MSYS2 shell, execute the following command to update the package database and core system packages:

    ```sh
    pacman -Syu
    ```

    > MSYS2 uses [`pacman`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman "pacman") as it's package manager.

## MSYS2 Shell Environments

MSYS2 offers different shell environments tailored to specific use cases, such as MinGW-w64 Shell, MSYS2 Shell, and UCRT64 Shell. Each environment provides a distinct set of tools and configurations, catering to different development needs and compatibility requirements.

For detailed information about MSYS2 shell environments, refer to the official documentation [here](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/).

## Adding MSYS2 Shell as Profile in Windows Terminal

If you're using Windows Terminal as your preferred command-line interface, integrating MSYS2 shell is straightforward:

1. Open Windows Terminal. If you don't have Windows Terminal installed, you can get it from Microsoft Store (<https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=en-zm&gl=ZM>).

2. Navigate to `Settings` by clicking on the down arrow (v) icon in the title bar.

3. In the sidebar, click `Open JSON file` to edit profile settings in JSON format.

4. Open PowerShell in new tab and type:

    ```bash
    New-Guid
    ```

    Don't close the tab yet, you'll need these numbers later.

4. Back to profile settings, search for `profiles.list` and add a new profile entry for MSYS2 shell there. For example:
   
    ```json
    "profiles": 
    {
      "list":
      [
        {
          "commandline": "[MSYS2-INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY]/msys2_shell.cmd -defterm -here -no-start -[TERMINAL] -shell [SHELL]",
          "guid": "[{UNIQUE-GUID}]",
          "icon": "[MSYS2-INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY]/clang64.ico",
          "name": "MSYS2: Clang 64",
          "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%",
          "tabTitle": "MSYS2: Clang 64"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    - Copy your previously generated guid in PowerShell and replace `[{UNIQUE-GUID}]` with it.
    - Replace `[MSYS2-INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY]` with your MSYS2 installation directory. Example: `C:/msys64`.
    - Replace `[TERMINAL]` with your terminal environment of choice such as `msys2`, `mingw32`, `mingw64`, `ucrt64`, `clang32`, `clang64`, `clangarm64`.
    - Replace `[SHELL]` with your favorite shell such as `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`.

    Here's my final profile entry:

    ```json
    {
      "commandline": "D:/Programs/msys2/msys2_shell.cmd -defterm -here -no-start -clang64 -shell zsh",
      "guid": "{2d6986ca-4616-4a8f-b3b1-121043a4a7db}",
      "icon": "D:/Programs/msys2/clang64.ico",
      "name": "MSYS2: Clang 64",
      "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%",
      "tabTitle": "MSYS2: Clang 64"
    }
    ```

5. Save the `settings.json` file and restart Windows Terminal (optional). You should now see MSYS2 Shell as an available option in the dropdown menu.
